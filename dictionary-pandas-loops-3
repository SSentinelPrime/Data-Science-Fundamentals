#Why do we need dictionary?

#It has 'key' and 'value'
#Faster than lists
#What is key and value. Example:
#dictionary = {'spain' : 'madrid'}
#Key is spain.
#Values is madrid.

#dictionary
#create dictionary and look its keys and values
dictionary = {'spain' : 'madrid','usa' : 'vegas'}
print(dictionary.keys())
print(dictionary.values())
# Keys have to be immutable objects like string, boolean, float, integer or tubles
# List is not immutable
# Keys are unique
dictionary['spain'] = "barcelona"    # update existing entry
print(dictionary)
dictionary['france'] = "paris"       # Add new entry
print(dictionary)
del dictionary['spain']              # remove entry with key 'spain'
print(dictionary)
print('france' in dictionary)        # check include or not
dictionary.clear()                   # remove all entries in dict
print(dictionary)
# In order to run all code you need to take comment this line
#del dictionary         # delete entire dictionary     

#pandas
