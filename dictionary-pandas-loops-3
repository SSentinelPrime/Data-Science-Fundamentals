#Why do we need dictionary?

#It has 'key' and 'value'
#Faster than lists
#What is key and value. Example:
#dictionary = {'spain' : 'madrid'}
#Key is spain.
#Values is madrid.

#dictionary
#create dictionary and look its keys and values
dictionary = {'spain' : 'madrid','usa' : 'vegas'}
print(dictionary.keys())
print(dictionary.values())
# Keys have to be immutable objects like string, boolean, float, integer or tubles
# List is not immutable
# Keys are unique
dictionary['spain'] = "barcelona"    # update existing entry
print(dictionary)
dictionary['france'] = "paris"       # Add new entry
print(dictionary)
del dictionary['spain']              # remove entry with key 'spain'
print(dictionary)
print('france' in dictionary)        # check include or not
dictionary.clear()                   # remove all entries in dict
print(dictionary)
# In order to run all code you need to take comment this line
#del dictionary         # delete entire dictionary     

#pandas
data = pd.read_csv('../input/pokemon.csv')
series = data['Defense']        # data['Defense'] = series
print(type(series))
data_frame = data[['Defense']]  # data[['Defense']] = data frame
print(type(data_frame))
# Comparison operator
print(3 > 2)
print(3!=2)
# Boolean operators
print(True and False)
print(True or False)

# 1 - Filtering Pandas data frame
x = data['Defense']>200     # There are only 3 pokemons who have higher defense value than 200
data[x]

# 2 - Filtering pandas with logical_and
# There are only 2 pokemons who have higher defence value than 2oo and higher attack value than 100
data[np.logical_and(data['Defense']>200, data['Attack']>100 )]
# This is also same with previous code line. Therefore we can also use '&' for filtering.
data[(data['Defense']>200) & (data['Attack']>100)]

# Stay in loop if condition( i is not equal 5) is true
i = 0
while i != 5 :
    print('i is: ',i)
    i +=1
print(i,' is equal to 5')

# Stay in loop if condition( i is not equal 5) is true
lis = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in lis:
    print('i is: ',i)
print('')

# Enumerate index and value of list
# index : value = 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5
for index, value in enumerate(lis):
    print(index," : ",value)
print('')   

# For dictionaries
# We can use for loop to achive key and value of dictionary. We learnt key and value at dictionary part.
dictionary = {'spain':'madrid','france':'paris'}
for key,value in dictionary.items():
    print(key," : ",value)

# For pandas we can achieve index and value
for index,value in data[['Attack']][0:1].iterrows():
